There are 18 boards added. The data starts from 2017-09-12 for board RTXM191-400 and ends at 2022-09-28 for board RMUA130AN. We will write code to extract the added boards and the relevant data for this last question.

2024-08-21 21:14:21,701:INFO:Question: how manu boards added ? | Answer: Ans : 12(board values in File 2 but not in File 1 count: 12) 
Question: how manu boards removed ? Ans : 0

Here rows from file 2 are added and none removed from file 1.

Code Example 2 : Using Sort values and Join methods from dataFrame

In this example, we will load different data in two CSV files -

One file contains property records for albany county in NY for house sold with some details including address, price, etc.

Other file contain few fields from the US postal services ZIP code data with latitude and longitude coordinate.

Let's now use these files to create a new dataset by combining these files in a most feasible way.

We will start by iterating through

### Decision

Without enough details of the data, it would be near impossible to make an accurate assessment. The first thing to do would be to have a meeting with either or both companies and get feedback on the data provided. If possible, they should provide a brief explanation of the data and how it works. If the company is unable to provide enough details, data cleansing and data processing may be needed to enable better analysis of the data. 


### Next Steps

Regardless of the company
